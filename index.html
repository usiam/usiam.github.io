        Hey, I'm a rising Junior at the University of Rochester! I'm majoring in Physics and Astronomy, minoring in
        Mathematics and Computer Science, have a keen interest in Psychology, and hold a deep passion for teaching, anime,
        and gaming.

        I have worked on astronomy research involving void regions in the universe under the supervision of <a
            href="https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~kdouglass/Me/">Dr.
        Kelly A. Douglass </a>. But this summer I will be working with <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~dmawet/">Dr.
        Dimitri Mawet</a> and <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/ashley-baker">Dr. Ashley Baker</a> on
        exoplanets in the <a href="https://etlab.caltech.edu/">ET Lab</a>.

        While I intend to be involved in research during the semesters, I am also seeking some industry experience where I
        can put all my knowledge of data analysis and love for numbers to use in a more real-world and instant-feedback. So,
        if you have any opportunity to offer (or if you ever want to discuss anime or video games) please reach out to
        me.
